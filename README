Expense Tracker Mobile HTML5

This is a sample mobile application built with HTML5. Not intended to run as
production level code. Please do not hold your breath waiting to be impressed
with this code. This is supposed to be a very basic DB CRUD app, nothing fancy
or impressive. Expense Tracker Mobile HTML5 includes a copy of jQuery Mobile.

Don't want to download the code to try this out? No problem. This repo is also
available here on GitHub at the following URL. It will work in your desktop
browser, but it's really intended to run on your phone.
